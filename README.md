Barrio Distribution
===================

Stantard distribution made with Bootstrap_Barrio.

Activates and configure modules and blocks.

Define content types and view modes using Display Suite

## Get Started
You will need the following installed:

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), obviously
* [Node](https://nodejs.org), which includes the NPM package manager

When you have those, run this command:
```
$ composer create-project dfgroup/barrio-project:^8.1.0 MY_PROJECT --no-interaction
```
Composer will create a new directory called MY_PROJECT containing a ```docroot``` directory with a full Lightning code base therein. You can then install it like you would any other Drupal site.
